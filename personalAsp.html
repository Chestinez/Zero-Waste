        bag means I am always ready. No more need for flimsy plastic forks or styrofoam takeout boxes that easily contribute to landfills and the harming of natural biodiversity.

        This challenge can vary by time frame and the degree of challenge i want to self-impose. 
        This will display for my personal knowledge, my thresholds of waste generation and my improvising skills in overall waste reduction techniques. 
        Hence motivating myself in a fun self-challenge to continue doing my part and beyond, in my Zero-Waste aspirations.</td>

        Keeping a foldable tote in my outing bag or pocket means I will never have to use a plastic bag again. 
        Whether it is a last-minute bubble tea fix or a grocery minor grocery haul. 
        You will be surprised how often it comes in handy and how much total potential disposable plastic bags are salvaged from being tossed into a landfill.</td>

        Choosing to bike or walk for short distances gives me fresh air, movement, 
        and a little mental refresh, all while cutting back on fuel use and emissions from polluting the heavens. 
        It is healthier for myself and lighter on the planet. 
        I currently started with a few weekly errands or my daily morning commutes with either lesser modes of fuel-based transportation or no modes at all and stick to the human energy source.</td>

    <h2><strong>Overcoming My Challenges</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Starting a zero-waste lifestyle isn't easy. I might struggle with habits, convenience, and availability of eco-options.
      But I plan to stay committed by tracking progress, staying inspired by zero-waste communities online, and reminding myself that every small step counts.
      <br>
      For example, because most zero-waste commitments are challenges imposed on my daily lives I may easily struggle to endure and adapt to a new lifestyle. Furthermore my zero-waste pursuits may also clash with my family, as my grandmother may just dispose my 30-day trash jar without a further thought.
